### In components folder

Create index file

// This works
export { default as Cards } from './cards/cards.component';
export { default as Picker } from './picker/picker.component';
export { default as Chart } from './chart/chart.component';


import Cards from './cards/cards.component';
import Picker from './picker/picker.component';
import Chart from './chart/chart.component';

export {
    Cards,
    Picker,
    Chart
}

# In App
import { Cards, Chart, Picker } from './components';

No need to add index as it will think components as folder as there is no components.js
And find index.js inside component folder

### Styling with styled components
### Styling with module pattern

App.module.scss
module must be present it will return all the selector in object

import styles from './App.module.scss';

<div className={styles.container}>

</div>
