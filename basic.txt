### In components folder

Create index file

// This works
export { default as Cards } from './cards/cards.component';
export { default as Picker } from './picker/picker.component';
export { default as Chart } from './chart/chart.component';


import Cards from './cards/cards.component';
import Picker from './picker/picker.component';
import Chart from './chart/chart.component';

export {
    Cards,
    Picker,
    Chart
}

# In App
import { Cards, Chart, Picker } from './components';

No need to add index as it will think components as folder as there is no components.js
And find index.js inside component folder

### Styling with styled components
### Styling with module pattern

App.module.scss
module must be present it will return all the selector in object

import styles from './App.module.scss';

<div className={styles.container}>

</div>


### Misc

# Don't use Object.create as it is used to create object with prototype
Use spread operator or Object.assign to clone object

# Iterate over Object
Object.keys(data)
use map and for values data[key]
Object.values(data)

for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(data)) {
    console.log(key, value);
}
Use Object.entries gives array so we are using for...of


for...of - Iterate over Arrays and Strings

for...in - Iterate over Object properties
Acts like Object.keys(data)
Use data[key] to get access to Object.values(data)


Object.keys(daily).length to check for empty object

# Omit properties from object

const data = {...globalData}
delete data.lastUpdate

const {lastUpdate, ...data } = globalData
